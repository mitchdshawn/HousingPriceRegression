# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

**Shawn Mitchell**
**Project completed during Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly**


**Executive Summary**

Using the Ames housing dataset, we can iteratively clean the data to create a pricing prediction model that can predict housing prices with reasonable accuracy. Models will be uploaded to a Kaggle competition for scoring their performance against a dataset with unknown target pricing. Based on performance scores between cross validation, train/test split, and Kaggle score, a model is identified with reasonable accuracy at the end.

**Data Science Problem**

Do the provided features have a reasonably consistent correlation with housing prices in the Ames housing dataset, and can a linear regression model predict pricing on generalized unseen data sets of this housing data? If these correlations exist, we expect to be able to create a pricing prediction model with reasonable accuracy.

**Notebooks Included**

01 - Introduction, EDA, and data preprocessing
02 - Final data processing, initial model testing
03 - Production model iteration

**Python Requirements**
Code written in Python 3.7, libraries required includes pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn. Optionally, luminol can be used for an overview of outliers (not required for EDA process).
