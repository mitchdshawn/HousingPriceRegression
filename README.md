# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

**Shawn Mitchell**
**Project completed during Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly**


**Executive Summary**

Using the Ames housing dataset, we can clean and modify the data to allow a regression model to predict pricing accuracy with a reasonable level of accuracy.  The scikit learn RidgeCV model performs the best with the modified data this project generates.

**Data Science Problem**

Do the provided features have a reasonably consistent correlation with housing prices in the Ames housing dataset, and can a linear regression model predict pricing on generalized unseen data sets of this housing data?

**Notebooks Included**

01 - Introduction, EDA, and data preprocessing
02 - Final data processing, initial model testing
03 - Production model iteration

**Python Requirements**
Code written in Python 3.7, libraries required includes pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn.
